# AI-Based School Management System
An intelligent administrative solution featuring automated biometric attendance.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as a self-initiated effort after my Grade 8 examinations to solve real-world administrative challenges in schools. It is a comprehensive desktop application designed to manage student data, track academic performance, and automate attendance using Computer Vision.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Biometric Attendance:** Real-time facial recognition using OpenCV.
* **Student Information System:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for student records.
* **GUI Dashboard:** User-friendly interface built with Python's Tkinter.
* **Secure Database:** Managed data storage for grades, fees, and personal details.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI Framework:** Tkinter
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Face_Recognition
* **Database:** [Mention your database here, e.g., SQLite / MySQL / CSV]
* **Others:** NumPy, Pillow (PIL)

## 💡 Motivation
I built this project to transition from theoretical programming to practical application. It allowed me to explore advanced topics like **Computer Vision** and **Database Management** independently, which eventually led me to pursue a Computer Engineering vocational stream in High School.
